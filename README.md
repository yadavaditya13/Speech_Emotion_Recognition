# Speech_Emotion_Recognition

This project has one script that uses "librosa" a python library for audio feature extraction and sklearn neural-network model "MLPClassifier" ... for speech emotion recognition.
The scipt trains the model using "RAVDESS dataset" ... and the model is trained model is saved in the working directory (p.s:. you can decide that) ... This model file now can be used to test unknown samples of your own audio files. and you can change labels and train accordingly the model as well (among the available ones)
I further tested the model on my own audio and you can do the same.
